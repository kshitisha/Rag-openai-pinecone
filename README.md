# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Context-Aware Question Answering

This repo contains a simple but effective **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline using:

- **OpenAI** (for language generation)
- **Pinecone** or **FAISS** (for vector similarity search)
- **LangChain** (to link everything together)

## üí° What it does

Given a query, it searches your knowledge base, retrieves relevant chunks, and then feeds them into OpenAI to generate an intelligent response ‚Äî just like a chatbot with memory!
